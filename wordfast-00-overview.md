# Overview

[Wordfast](https://www.wordfast.com/products/wordfast_pro) is a CAT that started first as an add-on to Microsoft Word (now called Wordfast Classic). Later, it was developed into a desktop application, called Wordfast Pro.

In this project, Wordfast Pro 8 ver. 8.1.0 was used.

Wordfast Pro 8 was chosen because a licence was available to the author and it is fairly [popular among translators](https://go.proz.com/blog/cat-tool-use-by-translators-what-are-they-using "Proz article on CAT use").

The discussion of the test file in Wordfast is grouped into three sections:

1. [Settings](wordfast-01-settings.md)
2. [Results](wordfast-02-results.md)
3. [Summary and recommendations](wordfast-03-summary-and-recommendations.md)
