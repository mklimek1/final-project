# Recommendations for translation of Markdown files in Wordfast Pro

1. Beware of joining strikethrough, bold, and italic - some combination may cause errors.
2. Basically, for best performance - tick everything, even if it means pasting links.
3. It's better to avoid `_` as a tag, as it may cause ignored text in tables.
4. translating of reference is possible but the translator needs guidance how to do it correctly

Once everything is ticked, it works smooth.
