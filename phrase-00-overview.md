# Overview

[Phrase](https://phrase.com/) (earlier: Memsource) is a cloud-based translation management system, which also includes a CAT tool. It is completely web-based, meaning it is used via a web browser.

In this project, Phrase CAT web editor ver. 23.18.1 was used.

Phrase was chosen, because the author uses Phrase CAT editor thanks to the courtesy of one translation agency. However, a trial account was created to configure Markdown filters and import the test file.

The discussion of the test file in Phrase is grouped into three sections:

1. [Settings](phrase-01-settings.md)
2. [Results](phrase-02-results.md)
3. [Summary and recommendations](phrase-03-summary-and-recommendations.md)
