# About

<!-- ADD MORE STUFF IF TIME ALLOWS AND PERMITS AND IS KIND-->

This section is about the project, references, and the author. Here you can learn the details about how the project was created, why this topic was selected, and what tools were used.

Here I'd like to mention [Kacper Bojakowski's](https://github.com/kacperbojakowski) project [Technical Writing for Translators](https://kacperbojakowski.github.io/final-project/) as a source of inspiration for the form of my project, even though the topic is radically different.

# Author

Hi, I'm Paweł and I'm a technical translator with 10 years of experience. I translate mostly instruction manuals and other types of technical documentation. In 2022, I decided to enrol on the [Technical Communication](https://vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/komunikacja-techniczna) studies at [Vistula University](https://vistula.edu.pl/en) to try my hand at creating technical documentation rather than translating it. Now, I'm open to embark on a new adventure bringing a translator's perspective to the table.
