Format settings:
1. Soft Line Break Type:
	1. tag (default for others)
	2. break (this doesn't do much in this file)
	3. none (as above)
2. Extract table headers
3. Extract Image Alt Text
4. Extract Image Link Value
5. Extract Image Title
6. Extract Href URL Title

Default settings:
1. Soft Line Break Type â€” tag
2. Extract table headers

I use the default settings and check further boxes until all are checked.
