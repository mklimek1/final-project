# Final considerations

This marks the end of the Markdown test carried out in Phrase, Trados Studio 2022, and Wordfast.

One may wonder: **Is there a CAT that is best suited for translating Markdown files?**

There is no simple answer to that question. Additionally, it rests on a false premise that a tool — like a CAT — can be a one-size-fits-all-Swiss-army-jack-of-all-trades solution.

No. A tool is selected for a specific purpose and here this is just as valid.

Analyse your text, analyse available options, and only then choose your CAT. <!-- Meow ;-)-->
