# The test file

To check the settings of the Markdown filter in Phrase, Trados Studio 2022, and Wordfast Pro 8, a test file was prepared. The assumption was to use all basic and extended Markdown tags in different combinations.

Also, HTML with JavaScript was embedded in the test file. HTML and scripts are often used  in Markdown files. As a result, this use case is also covered in the study.

The test file is a Markdown guidebook. It includes the list of Markdown tags, their syntax, and the expected results are presented. That is why Markdown syntax is omitted in this page.

The test file can be found [here](./resources/Markdown-in-CAT-test.md).

In the study, there are two phrases recurring with the following meanings:
1. `ignored` — this means that a given item is not displayed by the CAT
2. `rendered normally` — this means that Markdown or HTML tags are displayed with normal characters instead of tags inserted by the CAT

Surprising results are noted as follows: <kbd>&#128680;REALLY!</kbd>
