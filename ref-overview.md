This section covers basic information on Markdown, CAT software, and the difficulties CAT programs have with Markdown. If you are a technical writer, you may skip the section on Markdown. If you are a translator, you may skip the section on CAT software. However, it is recommended to read both sections to have unified background knowledge on the matter.
